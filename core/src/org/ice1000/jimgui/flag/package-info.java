/**
 * ImGui uses int flags by default. In addition to the FlagsClass.CONSTANTS
 * provided by each interface a library user will find FlagClass.Type which
 * are Enumerations that Implement the Flag interface and mirror the
 * FlagClass.CONSTANTS to allow for object oriented programming and human
 * readable reverse lookups which are useful for the developer to set
 * flags easier. Flags.class has some helper methods for flags and numbers.
